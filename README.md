# AI-Powered Mental Health Support System

## Project Overview
Mental health challenges among undergraduates have increased significantly due to academic pressure, social stress, financial instability, and lifestyle changes. Many students delay or avoid seeking professional help because of stigma, lack of awareness, or limited access to timely mental health services.

This project proposes an **AI-Powered Mental Health and Emotional Support System for Undergraduates** that provides **real-time, personalized, and empathetic support** using artificial intelligence. The system leverages **multimodal emotion detection** (text, voice, and facial expressions) to understand a user’s emotional state and deliver appropriate **emotion-adaptive interventions** and **CBT-based exercises**. The solution is designed as a supportive tool to enhance emotional well-being and is **not intended to replace professional mental health care**.

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular and scalable architecture consisting of multiple AI-driven components that work together to provide emotional support.

### Core Components:
1. **Conversational AI Module (Text & Voice)**
   - Detects emotions using NLP-based sentiment analysis and speech emotion recognition.
   - Provides empathetic, real-time responses through a chatbot interface.

2. **Facial Emotion Detection Module (Image/Video)**
   - Uses live webcam input to analyze facial expressions.
   - Enhances emotional understanding through computer vision models.

3. **Emotion-Adaptive Intervention Generator**
   - Delivers immediate micro-interventions such as breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and motivational prompts.
   - Adapts responses based on emotion intensity and user history.

4. **CBT Exercise Generator & Progress Tracker**
   - Identifies cognitive distortions from user input.
   - Generates personalized CBT exercises and tracks emotional progress over time.

5. **Data Storage & Analytics Layer**
   - Securely stores anonymized interaction data.
   - Supports emotion trend analysis and adaptive learning.
